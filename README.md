# Catatouille-Final
This is the code for the program Catatouille made for ICS4U. It mainly functions to organize recipes and allows the user to take URLs and scrape recipe data into a readable format.

Recipe.java is where the web scraper (Jsoup) is programmed to target specific elements of a website to find the corresponding elements of a recipe. These elements are taken, then sorted and stored in a text file. 

The remaining pages correspond to "pages" (different sections) of the program. When a specific button is pressed, the page gets switched to another page with which the user can interact.
