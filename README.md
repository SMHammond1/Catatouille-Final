# Catatouille-Final
This is the code for the program Catatouille made for ICS4U. It mainly functions to organize recipes and allows the user to take URLs and scrape recipe data into a readable format.

Recipe.java is where the web scraper (Jsoup) is programmed to target specific elements of a website to find the corresponding elements of a recipe. These elements are taken, then sorted and stored in a text file. To use this code, install Jsoup into the program with which you are programming (ex. Netbeans, VS Code, etc.) 

The remaining pages correspond to "pages" (different sections) of the program. When a specific button is pressed, the page gets switched to another page with which the user can interact. 

As of 06/24/2022, this code is still a work in progress and will be updated semi-regularly.
